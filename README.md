org-capture Apple Shortcut
More detail can be found at [this blog post](https://blog.samhain.io/posts/org-capture-shortcut]

When importing this shortcut, it /should/ ask you a few questions as a setup:
- Folder location for your personal org files
- Folder location for your work org files
- Filname (without path) of your personal TODO file
- Filename (without path) of your work TODO file
- Filename (without path) of your personal notes file
- Filename (without path) of your work notes file

That being said, this shortcut is based on my use-case. If you also need personal and work todos and notes, it should work out of the box for you. You can otherwise edit it to meet your own use-case.

If you find this shortcut useful, I only ask that you link back to me [at my blog](https://blog.samhain.io] or at my [mastodon account](https://emacs.ch/@grim).
